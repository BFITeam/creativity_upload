\footnotesize {\it Note:} This table reports average output, time spent working, and output per time worked. 
This refers to the number of correctly positioned sliders in the slider task and to the creativity score in the creative task (please refer to section 3.1 for a description of the scoring procedure). 
Time spent working is the total time (3 minutes) less the number of breaks time the length of breaks (20 seconds). 
Output per time worked is the ratio of those two quantities. 
\% Difference is the percentage change between the Tournament and Control groups. 
Panel one reports these statistics for Period 1 and panel two reports them for Period 1. 
The third panel reports the change between periods by calculating the difference Period 2 less Period 1. 
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the tournament. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. \end{minipage}
