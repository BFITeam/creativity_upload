\footnotesize {\it Note:} The table reports OLS estimates of treatment effects on originality scores. 
The originality score used in the main analysis is taken from the Torrence Test of Creative Thinking and awards 1 point for every answer that was given by less than 8\% of other participants and one additional bonus point for answers that were given by less than 1\% of other participants. 
In this table, the 8\% cutoff was varied to be either 10\%, 5\%, or 1\%. 
The first three columns use the standardized originality score as the dependent variable. 
The last three columns present the originality rate. 
The rate controls for the number of valid answers given and was created by dividing the raw originality score by the number of valid answers given in each period. \\
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the tournament/gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. 
Additional control variables are age, age squared, sex, location, field of study as well as a set of time fixed effects (semester period, semester break, exam period). 
Heteroscedastic-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * p < 0:1, ** p < 0:05, *** p < 0:01.
