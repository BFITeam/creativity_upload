\footnotesize {\it Note:} This table reports OLS estimates of treatment effects in the Creative Task with Discretionary Transfers. 
In the Creative Task with Discretionary Transfer activity, participants complete the creative task. At the end of each period, they see how many Taler they earned and may transfer up to that amount to their principal. 
Standardized Transfered is the amount transferred back to the principal. 
In the creative task, agends are evaluated by the creativity score (please refer to section 3.1 for a description of the scoring procedure). 
Standardized Effort Period 2 refers to this outcome metric. 
Basline refers to the value of the dependent variable in Period 1. \\
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from Gift treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. 
Heteroscedastic-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * p < 0:1, ** p < 0:05, *** p < 0:01.
