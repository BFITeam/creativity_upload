\footnotesize {\it Note:} This table reports OLS estimates of treatment effects in the slider task by baseline performance. 
Columns I and II report treatment effects on the performance of agents whose performance was below (Column I) and above (Column II) average in period 1 (as compared to the control group). 
In the slider task, agents are evaluated by the number of correctly positioned sliders. 
The dependent variable is standardized performance in Period 2. \\
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the tournament/gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. 
Additional control variables are age, age squared, sex, location, field of study as well as a set of time fixed effects (semester period, semester break, exam period). 
Heteroscedastic-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * p < 0:1, ** p < 0:05, *** p < 0:01.
