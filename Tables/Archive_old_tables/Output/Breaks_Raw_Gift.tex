\footnotesize {\it Note:} This table reports raw, unstandardized, average output, time spent working, and output per time worked. 
This refers to the number of correctly positioned sliders in the slider task and to the creativity score in the creative task (please refer to section 3.1 for a description of the scoring procedure). 
Time spent working is the total time (3 minutes) less the number of breaks times the length of breaks (20 seconds). 
Output per time worked is the ratio of those two quantities. 
Participants could take breaks by hitting a time-out button to turn off their computer screen for 20 seconds. This button was deactivated if less than 20 seconds remained in the period. They recieved 5 Taler (0.05 Euros) each time they took a break. 
Log Difference is the log of the treatment group statistic less the log of the control group statistic. Log differences provide a better sense of relative effect sizes. 
Panel one reports these statistics for Period 1 and panel two reports them for Period 2. Note that penel two ignores baseline differences in performance. 
The third panel reports the change between periods by calculating the raw difference Period 2 less Period 1.
