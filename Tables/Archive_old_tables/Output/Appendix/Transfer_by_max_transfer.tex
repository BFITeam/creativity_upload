\footnotesize {\it Note:} This table reports OLS estimates of treatment effects in the Creative Task with Discretionary Transfers -- Gift. 
In the Creative Task with Discretionary Transfer treatments (Gift and Control) agentsâ€™ performance is evaluated using the same creativity scoring procedure that we use in the creative task treatments (please refer to section 3.1. for a description of the scoring procedure). 
In the discretionary transfer treatments, agents learn at the end of each period, how many Taler they earned and may transfer up to that amount to their principal. 
The dependent variable is the standardized amount transferred to the principal. It is standardized to give the Creative Task with Discretionary Transfers -- Control Group mean zero and variance one. 
Agents with a creativity score of 0 and who cannot transfer any amount are included in the first column. \\
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from Gift treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. 
Heteroscedastic-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * p < 0:1, ** p < 0:05, *** p < 0:01.
