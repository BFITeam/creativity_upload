{\it Note:} This table reports the estimated OLS coefficient estimates for the \textit{Feedback} Treatment for Periods 2 and 3. Period 3 effects are split up by the whether person learned that they did or did not belong to the 50\% top performers. Feedback effects for Period 2 are regression coefficients from  specification IV in Table \ref{tab:EQ_Pooled_Results} while post-treatment effects for Period 3 are from Table \ref{tab:Period3}. 
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the tournament/gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. Control variables include observations from the \textit{Gift} treatment, the \textit{Tournament} treatment, and the \textit{Control} group. Additionally, we control for age, age squared, sex, location, field of study as well as a set of time fixed  effects (semester period, semester break, exam period). The \textit{Control} group serves as the reference category. Heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * $p < 0.1$, ** $p < 0.05$, *** $p < 0.01$.
