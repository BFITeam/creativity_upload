{\it Note:} In order to create a more realistic work environment  in which agents face opportunity costs of working, we implemented a time-out button (see Section \ref{sec:groups}) which was displayed at the bottom of the screen during all working periods. Each time agents clicked the time-out button, the computer screen was locked for 20 seconds, prohibiting the entry of creative ideas or the movement of sliders, and 5 Taler were added to the agent's payoff.\\ 
This table reports OLS coefficient estimates from our main model specification (Equation \ref{eq:reg},  with the number of breaks in period 1, the change in breaks between periods 1 and 2, as well as interactions between the two as additional controls. Standardized performance in period 2 is the dependent variable. Performance is measured as the number of correctly positioned sliders in the simple task and as the score in the unusal uses, creative task, respectively.\\
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the tournament/gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. Heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors including a degree of freedom correction are reported in parentheses. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * $p < 0.1$, ** $p < 0.05$, *** $p < 0.01$. \end{minipage}
