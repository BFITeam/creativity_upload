\footnotesize {\it Note:} The table reports OLS estimates of treatment effects on standardized alternative specifications of the originality score. 
The creativity score that participants were evaluated on gave 1 point for every answer that was given by less than 8\% of other participants and a bonus point for every answers that were given by less than 1\% of other participants. This table changes the 8\% cutoff to either 10\% or 5\%. Very original answers awards points only for answers given by less than 1\% of other participants.
The rate columns take the raw value and divide by the number of valid answers given in each period. \\
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the tournament/gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. Additional control variables are age, age squared, sex, location, field of study as well as a set of time fixed effects (semester period, semester break, exam period). Heteroscedastic-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * p < 0:1, ** p < 0:05, *** p < 0:01. \end{minipage}
