\footnotesize {\it Note:} This table reports mean values by treatment and by whether or not the agent transferred the maximum amount to the principal in Period 1. 
In the Creative Task with Discretionary Transfer treatments (Gift and Control) agentsâ€™ performance is evaluated using the same creativity scoring procedure that we use in the creative task treatments (please refer to section 3.1. for a description of the scoring procedure). In the discretionary transfer treatments, agents learn at the end of each period, how many Taler they earned and may transfer up to that amount to their principal. Agents who have a creativity score of 0 and who cannot transfer any amount are included in the third column. 
Note that this analysis uses the score that participants saw during the experiment (instead of the score that uses updated originality ratings that we use for our main analyses). Transfer refers to the amount that the agent transfers to the principal. \\
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from Gift treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis.
