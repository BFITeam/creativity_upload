\footnotesize {\it Note:} This table reports mean values by treatment and period for various dimensions of the creativity score.
Validity, Flexibility, and Originality are the subdimensions of the creativity score. 
The Original Answers columns report the number of answers the participants gave that were also given by fewer than 10/5/1\% of other participants. 
The sample includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the tournament/gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis.
