{\it Note:} This table reports OLS estimates of Equation \ref{eq:reg}, where we regress (standardized) performance in Period 2 on baseline performance and treatment dummies. Column I reports results on the aggregated creativity score. Columns II, III and V report the results on the different standardized sub-dimensions of the creativity score.  Column IV and VI displays treatment effects on the (unstandardized) flexibility and originality rate. The flexibility (originality) rate equals achieved flexibility (originality) points divided by the total number of subject's valid answers (subjects with zero valid answers were dropped in these columns). Column VII reports results for an assesment of the best creative answers from an evaluator blind to the treatments. Column VIII report results for invalid uses.\\
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the tournament/gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. Additional control variables are age, age squared, sex, location, field of study as well as a set of time fixed  effects (semester period, semester break, exam period). Heteroscedastic-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * $p < 0.1$, ** $p < 0.05$, *** $p < 0.01$.
%\textsuperscript{1} The flexibility (originality) rate equals achieved flexibility (originality) points divided by the number of subject's valid answers. The sample size is reduced to 215 observations because we cannot calculate the flexibility or originality rate (or it's baseline) for individuals who do not provide any answers in either period 1 or period 2.
