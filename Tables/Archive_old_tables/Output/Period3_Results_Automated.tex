\footnotesize {\it Note:} This table reports the estimated OLS in Period 3 analogous to Equation \ref{eq:reg}. 
Performance is measured as the number of correctly positioned sliders, as the score achieved in the  creativity task, and as the amount transferred in the Discretionary Transfer tasks. 
The treatment dummies \textit{Gift} and \textit{Tournament} capture the effect of an unconditional wage gift or of a tournament incentive (rewarding the top 2 performers out of 4 agents) on standardized performance. 
The \textit{Discretionary Transfer} coefficent captures any difference between control groups for the creative task with discretionary transfer and creative task without discretionary transfer. 
The \textit{Discretionary Transfer x Gift} coefficient captures the effect of an unconditional wage gift on the standardized amount transfered to the principal. 
That is, the estimated effect of allowing discretionary transfers and the gift treatment on the creative task is the \textit{Discretionary Transfer x Gift} coefficient less the \textit{Discretionary Transfer} coefficient. \\
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the tournament/gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. 
Additional control variables are age, age squared, sex, location, field of study as well as a set of time fixed effects (semester period, semester break, exam period). 
Heteroscedastic-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * p < 0:1, ** p < 0:05, *** p < 0:01.
