\footnotesize {\it Note:} This table reports the estimated OLS coefficients from Equation \ref{eq:reg} (using observations from the creative task only). 
In the Gift and Tournament treatment groups, the principals could choose to implement an unconditional monetary gift for all or of a tournament incentive (rewarding the top two performers out of their four agents) between Periods 1 and 2. 
\textit{Gift} and \textit{Tournament} refer to these two treatments. 
The dependent variable in column I is the standardized creativity score in Period 2. 
This refers to the the creativity score (please refer to section 3.1 for a description of the scoring procedure). 
In columns II, III, and IV, the dependent variables are the three different standardized subdimensions of the creativity score (validity, fluency, and originality). 
Columns V and VI display treatment effects on the unstandardized flexibility and originality rate. 
The flexibility (orginality) rate equals flexibility (originality) points divided by the number of valid answers (subjects with zero valid answers are dropped from these columns). 
Column VII reports results for a subjective assessment idea quality (unstandardized). To create this variable, an evaluator blind to the treatments was instructed to indicated for each idea whether they considered it to be a  or  idea. 
Column VIII report results for invalid uses (unstandardized). \\
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the tournament/gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. 
Additional control variables are age, age squared, sex, location, field of study as well as a set of time fixed effects (semester period, semester break, exam period). 
Heteroscedastic-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * p < 0:1, ** p < 0:05, *** p < 0:01.
