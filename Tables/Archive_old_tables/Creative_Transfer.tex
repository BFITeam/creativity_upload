{\it Note:} This table reports the estimated OLS coefficients from Equation \ref{eq:reg}. The dependent variable is the standardized amount transferred in Period 2. Amount transferred refers to the treatment in which agents work on the creative task, are informed about the number of points that they generated with their answers and can then decide how many of those points to transfer to their principal. The coefficient on the \textit{Tournament} (\textit{Gift}) treatment represents the impact of the \textit{Tournament} (\textit{Gift}) on the creative task. The interaction effect between the respective treatment and the slider task documents whether the response to the \textit{Tournament} (\textit{Gift}) differs between the creative and the simple task. The impact of the tournament (\textit{Gift}) on the simple task is equal to the sum of the coefficient on the treatment and its interaction effect.\\
The estimation includes all agents from the Control Group as well as agents from treatment groups where the principal decided to institute the tournament/gift. Agents with negative reward decisions are not part of this analysis. Additional control variables are age, age squared, sex, location, field of study as well as a set of time fixed  effects (semester period, semester break, exam period). Heteroscedastic-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * $p < 0.1$, ** $p < 0.05$, *** $p < 0.01$.
