\footnotesize NOTE.--This table reports mean values by treatment and by whether or not the agent transferred all of their output to the principal in Period 1. 
In the supplementary gift treatment and the supplementary control treatment, agents learned how much output they had generated for the principal in the previous round and could then decide how much of that output to transfer to the principal. This procedure contrasts with the one in the main creative task \textit{Gift} treatment and the main creative task \textit{Control} group in that in the main treatments each agent's entire output was automatically transferred as payoff to the principal. Note that the estimations in this table are based on the value of output that was communicated to the agents during the experiment, which relied on originality ratings from our pre-test. 
The value of output that we use in our main analysis was calculated using an updated originality rating scale. \textit{Output} refers to the creativity score in the creative task (please refer to Section 3.2.2 for a description of the scoring procedure in the creative task). \textit{Transfer} refers to the amount of output that the agent transfers to the principal. 
Agents with a creativity score of 0 and who, therefore, cannot transfer any amount are included in the final two columns. 

The estimations include all agents from the \textit{Creative Task with Discretionary Transfers -- Control} group as well as agents from the \textit{Creative Task with Discretionary Transfers -- Gift} treatment group for which the principal decided to implement the gift. Agents from treatment groups for which the principal did not implement the gift are not included in this analysis.
