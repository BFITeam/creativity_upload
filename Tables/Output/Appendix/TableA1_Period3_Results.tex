\footnotesize NOTE.--This table reports the estimated OLS coefficients in Period 3. 
The analysis shown in this table follows the set-up laid out in Equation 1 with the exception that we estimate the equation separately for both tasks. 
The even columns estimate the effect of receiving the performance bonus and not receiving it separately. 
Output is measured as the number of correctly positioned sliders in the simple task, as the creativity score in the creative task (please refer to Section 3.2.2 for a description of the scoring procedure in the creative task), and as the amount transferred in the discretionary transfer treatments. 
The treatment dummies \textit{Gift} and \textit{Performance Bonus} capture the effect of a performance-independent wage gift for all or of a performance-dependent performance bonus (rewarding the top two performers out of four agents) on standardized output. 
The \textit{Discretionary Transfer} coefficient captures any difference between the \textit{Creative Task with Discretionary Transfer -- Control} group and the main \textit{Control} group. 
The \textit{Discretionary Transfer x Gift} coefficient captures the effect of a performance-independent wage gift for all on the standardized amount transferred to the principal. 
That is, the estimated effect of allowing discretionary transfers and offering a wage gift in the creative task equals the sum of the \textit{Discretionary Transfer x Gift} coefficient and the \textit{Discretionary Transfer} coefficient. 
\textit{Performance Bonus Winner} and \textit{Performance Bonus Loser} capture the effect of receiving the performance bonus in Period 2 or not receiving the performance bonus in Period 2 on output in Period 3. 

Each estimation includes all agents from the \textit{Control} group and agents from treatment groups for which the principal decided to implement the performance bonus or gift. Agents from treatment groups for which the principal did not implement a reward are not included in this analysis. 
Additional control variables are age, age squared, sex, location, field of study, and a set of time fixed effects (semester period, semester break, exam period). 
Heteroscedastic-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses.
