\footnotesize NOTE.--This table reports the results from the supplementary \textit{Creative Task with Discretionary Transfers} treatments. 
In the supplementary gift treatment and the supplementary control treatment, agents learned how much output they had generated for the principal in the previous round and could then decide how much of that output to transfer to the principal. 
This procedure contrasts with the one in the main creative task \textit{Gift} treatment and the main creative task \textit{Control} group in that in the main treatments each agent's entire output was automatically transferred as payoff to the principal. 
This table reports the estimated OLS coefficients from a regression of the standardized amount transferred in Period 2 on an indicator for the \textit{Gift} treatment and on the standardized amount transferred in Period 1. 
The treatment dummy \textit{Gift} captures the effect of a performance-independent wage gift for all on the standardized amount transferred back to the principal. 

The estimations include all agents from the \textit{Creative Task with Discretionary Transfers -- Control} group as well as agents from the \textit{Creative Task with Discretionary Transfers -- Gift} treatment group for which the principal decided to implement the gift. Agents from treatment groups for which the principal did not implement the gift are not included in this analysis. 
Additional control variables are age, age squared, sex, location, field of study, and a set of time fixed effects (semester period, semester break, exam period). 
Heteroscedastic-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses.
